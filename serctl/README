Serctl is utility for SER administration.

Manpages are mostly out-of-date.

			database should be derived from this class,

			new SQL backends),

			use class from this module, not directly classes from
			dbmysql, dbpostgres, etc.),

HOW TO ADD NEW FUNCTIONALITY
============================

  * Add new name for serctl tool, if necessary.
  * Add new constants (if needed) and their default values into config.py.
  * Add new error definitions (if needed) into error.py.
  * Add module and/or functions implementig required functionality.
  * Add name of module's functions and options and their abbrevations 
    to options.py.
  * Add description for new options into ctlhelp.py.

New name for tool:
------------------
Copy or link any ser_* command as new command ser_<modname>. Where <modname>
is name of new module. (e.g. ln -s ser_user ser_tea)

New module:
-----------
Module is file of name ctl<modname>.py in serctl directory.
Module (in this form) is automaticaly recognized and used.
Module functions are called with apropriare parameters determined from
command line and function definition. Example:

Command:

	$> ser_tea brew green sweet lemon --quantity 0.5

automaticaly call function 'brew' from module tea (serctl/ctltea.py).
Function brew may be declared such as:

	>>> def brew(type, sweetness='bitter', *ingredients, **opts):
	>>>     if int(opts['QUANTITY']) > 2:
        >>> 	    raise 'Sorry, I have not that tea-cup.'
            ...

Serctl automaticaly recognizes which positional parameters on command line
are mandatory (declared without default value) and which are optional
(declared with default value, or passed to argument list, e.g. ingredients
above). Options are passed to keyword-argument (**opts) if function declare
it. Checks if command line is correct was done before function call. Function
itself needn't deal with them. When error is ocured when command line params
are parsed parameter's name from funcion declaration is used to report which
parameter can't be processed.
E.g. with example above, when it's call (without mandatory parameter type):

	$> ser_tea brew 

Folowing exception will be raised:

	$> ser_tea: type: Argument required

Any functions that should be visible as commands must be added to CMD
dictionary in options.py. See options.py.

Errors and exceptions:
----------------------
Please, keep all error codes in upper case characters and in the form E*.

Error may be invoked from code as exception:

	>>> from serctl.error import Error, ECODE
	>>> raise Error (ECODE, 'what')

Where 'what' is short description what cause error - parameter name or value,
for example. This parameter may be omitted.
