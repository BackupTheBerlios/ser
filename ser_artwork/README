SER Artwork
===========

This directory contains a couple of images and logos that can be used together
with the SIP Express Router and related utilities. The collection contains
logos for SER, SERWeb, RTPProxy, and SEMS.

* You can use the artwork for any project that is based on or uses SER and
  accompanying utilities.
  
* You can use the images to demonstrate your support for the project and place
  them on your webpage.
    
* We would like to encourage people to publicly demonstrate that their servers
  or services are based on the SIP Express Router. We give away the software
  for free and the least you could do for us is to announce that you find
  the software useful. The best way how to do that is placing the small
  "SER-Powered" logo on your website along with a link to the homepage of
  SER.
  
Description
-----------

Subdirectory psd contains the source files for Photoshop that were used to
generate the JPEG images. You can use the Photoshop source files if you
need to generate the images in a different size or file format, or different
level of compression.

Subdirectory jpg contains pre-generated JPEG files in various sizes, the
names of the subdirectories are self-explanatory.

Subdirectory jpg/notext contains a special version of the main logo with
no text or description attached to it. This image (or its psd version) can
be used to generate logos with custom text or description. Custom logos should
try to follow the style common for all other logos. Preferable color scheme is 
blue.

The image itself expresses a man holding two maritime signaling flags (one up,
one down). This system has been used at sea for communication between ships.
SER and accompanying utilities mostly work with SIP signaling and their
purpose is to enable real-time communication in the internet  -- hence the 
analogy to the maritime flag signaling system :-)

I bought this image under a non-exclusive licence and it is possible, although
the chance is quite small, that it will be used also used by someone else.
