KPhone with GSM authentication support
======================================

[05.08.2003]
- http://www.iptel.org/~dcm/ser-gsm/kphone-3.11.1-gsm.tgz has support for
  authenticating the INVITE and MESSAGE requests using GSM schema
- http://www.iptel.org/~dcm/ser-gsm/auth_gsm.1.cfg is a sample of how
  to challenge SIP requests for GSM authentication 

[04.08.2003]
- http://www.iptel.org/~dcm/ser-gsm/kphone-3.11.0-gsm.tgz integrates now a
  configure file that detects the existence of pcsc-lite library in system
- you have o use: ./configure --enable-gsm_auth. 
- if the pcsc-lite library is installed in a specific directory, not as
  usually (/lib, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib) you can try: ./configure
  --enable-gsm_auth --with-pcsclite-dir='/path/to/pcsclite' -- it should work,
  I haven't tested yet
- if the pcsc-lite library isn't found the configure prints a message and
  exits.
- when use simple ./configure the gsm_auth support is disabled and kphone is
  compiled as it is in the official release 3.11
- if everything works ok with configure, then you can compile with 'make' (the
  visible issue while compiling is the flag -DWITH_GSM_AUTH)

This version supports SIP registration with GSM authentication.

You have to ungzip/untar the archive, then run ./configure and make. A version
of configure that checks the existence of pcsc-lite library is upcoming. Now it
assumes that the library is already installed in your computer (usually in
/usr/local/lib -- be sure this path is in ld.so.conf in order to be found by
linker).

You may run kphone from source directory (./kphone/kphone) or do make install
and type kphone in any console.

When KPhone prompts for password you must introduce the PIN for GSM sim. Be
aware: if you introduce a wrong PIN code you must restart KPhone. It will block
for I don't know what reason even the timeout for SIM card operations is 5
seconds -- I will try to find a workaround for that.

You can use SER with GSM authentication request to test KPhone. Don't challenge
something else than REGISTER for moment, for the other methods GSM
authentication is still work in progress.

GSM authentication schema used in KPhone is described in "readme.txt".
