This example shows how an external application,
weather station, can easily trigger SIP events
via ser's textual FIFO interface. The poll utility
asks a weather station via RS232 about current
weather and tells ser to send a MESSAGE to a given
SIP address.

The example is based on a tool wx2000, written by 
Friedrich Zabel and distributed under the GPL.
See README.wx.
