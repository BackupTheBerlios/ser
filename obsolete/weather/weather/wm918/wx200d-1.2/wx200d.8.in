.TH WX200D 8 "Sep 09, 2001" "wx200d Manual"
.SH NAME
wx200d \- weather data collector and server for WX200 or WMR918
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wx200d
[-h] [-d] [-a] [-b] [-z] [-p port] [-r] [-s device] [-w path] [-g] [-c connection] [-t tablename] [-i interval]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B wx200d
is a weather station data collector and server daemon for the
RadioShack WX200 (Cat. No. 63-1015), also known as the Oregon
Scientific WM918.  It also supports the wireless WMR918/968.
.B wx200d
can record WX200 data to (optionally compressed) files in two formats.
See
.B wx200d(5)
for details of these file formats.

If available,
.B wx200d
can output data to a Postgres Database.

.B wx200d
also listens for client connections and tees the data out to those
clients.  Clients can connect to
.B wx200d
from any machine and display the weather data in real-time, as-if they
were accessing the WX200 hardware directly.

.P
.B wx200d
should be run one time only.  Typically it should be run by a script
like
.I /etc/rc.local
during the normal bootup process.
.P

.SH OPTIONS

.TP 0.5i
.B -h
Display a help usage message showing these options, then exit.

.TP 0.5i
.B -d
Debug mode; don't fork to be a daemon.  This makes it easy to hit C-c
to stop the server.  This mode leaves stdout and stderr file handles
open so you can see any error messages or output.

.TP 0.5i
.B -a
Do not record YYYYMMDD.tab tab-delimited ASCII log files.  Without
this option, one
.I .tab
file per day is created in
.I path.
These files are nice for plotting or for import to other systems.  Use
this option if you never make weather plots and want to save disk
space.

.TP 0.5i
.B -b
Do not record YYYYMMDD.bin binary data files.  Without this option,
one
.I .bin
file per day is created in
.I path.
These files contain all information produced by the WX200 in an
abbreviated format.  These files can be used to create
.I .tab
files, see
.B wxfilter(1).
Use this option only if you don't care to keep detail data and want to
save disk space.

.TP 0.5i
.B -z
Do not
.B gzip(1)
the log files each day after collection.  Without this option, the
daily log files are compressed with
.B gzip(1).
Use this option only if you don't want the logs compressed or if you
don't have
.B gzip(1).
Using this option will require more disk space.

.TP 0.5i
.B -p <port>
Listen for client connections on port
.I port
instead of the built-in default (9753).

.TP 0.5i
.B -r
Radio mode; read wireless WMR918/968 hardware.  Otherwise, it is
assumed to be wired WX200/WM918 hardware.

.TP 0.5i
.B -s <device>
Read weather station data from serial port
.I device
instead of the built-in default (/dev/wx200).  If
.B -r
is used or the
.I device
contains the string "wmr" (e.g. /dev/wmr918), it will be read as a
WMR918/968.  Otherwise it is assumed to be a WX200/WM918.

.TP 0.5i
.B -w <path>
Write logs to
.I path
instead of the built-in default (@datadir@/@PACKAGE@).

.TP 0.5i
.B -g
Enables logging to a Postgres database if Postgres libraries are
available.

.TP 0.5i
.B -c <connection>
Use this connection string to connect with the database
instead of "host=localhost user=postgres password=postgres port=5432".

.TP 0.5i
.B -t <tablename>
Use this table name to store the values in the database
instead of "wx_data". Error values and out-of-range values will be
stored also. If it does not exist, the table will be created.

.TP 0.5i
.B -i <interval>
Time interval, in seconds, to log values to the database. This value
is an integer value from 0 to 32767.

.SH FILES
@datadir@/@PACKAGE@/YYYYMMDD.tab[.gz]
@datadir@/@PACKAGE@/YYYYMMDD.bin[.gz]

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP 0.5i
.B WX200
The serial device from which to read WX200 data, if
.B -s
is not specified.  If this variable is not set, the built-in default
(/dev/wx200) is used.  This should be the serial device the physical
weather station hardware is connected to, or a symbolic link to it.
If
.I device
contains the string "wmr" (like a /dev/wmr918 symbolic link), it will
be read as a WMR918/968 device.  Otherwise it is assumed to be a
WX200/WM918.

.SH LIMITATIONS

The serial device must be writable (and readable) by the user running
.B wx200d.
Only one process should be reading the serial port at any time.
.P

If a sensor is reporting an error condition, the last successful
number is logged, instead of zero or nothing.  This is so that the
error won't adversely affect average, low and high calculations when
rolled up into the summary logs.

.SH BUGS
Possibly.
