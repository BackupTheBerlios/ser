	NOT YET NEWS	or	NOTES ABOUT THINGS TO COME
	============		==========================


	NEW for 1.2	Released April 2002
	===========	===================

* Much improved weather graphs via RRDtool (http://www.rrdtool.com/)
  Believe me, you want to install RRDtool and get this working.  See
  README for details.  Then you can drop the old wxplot2html!

* The WMR918 (and probably the WMR968) wireless station is now
  supported (at least all the bits that are known) thanks to code
  contributed by Dominique Le Foll.  Use -r to drive the newer
  stations.


	NEW for 1.1	Released August 2001
	===========	====================

* fixed wxsum bug that max temperature and wind chill in .day and .mon
  summaries were recorded as zero when they were really negative.  See
  README for notes on how to correct incorrect data files.

* new wunderground client can contribute your weather data to
  wunderground.com.  Requires a modern perl with the LWP module.

* continous plotting of all weather variables if you have Gnome
  gstripchart.  Simply say `gstripchart gstripchart.conf', make the
  window bigger and wait.  Indoor variables are off by default;
  right-click Params to turn them on.  Left-click to see current
  values.

* many new options for the wx200 client; see --help and wx200(1).

* wxplot can now take simple YYYYMMDD[.tab|.day] | YYYYMM.mon
  arguments.  If the given files do not exist, they are searched for
  in the data directory and .tab and .gz extentions are assumed if
  necessary.

* more standardized GNU-style build/install process via automake

* this causes the data path to change from share/wx200 to share/wx200d

* The server can now log to a Postgres database thanks to Raul Luna
  <rlunaro@bigfoot.com>.  If you add connections to other databases,
  or enhancements to this one, please let me know.

* You are pretty much on your own using the new database support
  though.  Basic logging to Postgres is there.  But it is up to you to
  figure out how to compress your data over time, generate graphs or
  reports from your database, and so on.  These capabilities may or
  may not get added in future versions and the table format may even
  change.  Basically, I don't have the time or need to develop this,
  but someone else may opt to enhance this capability.


	NEW for 1.0	Released February 2000
	===========	======================

* standard GNU-style `./configure; make; make install' process

* standard GNU-style installation paths.

* new cumulative rain total column in the log files.

* the server now records the computer's clock in the .tab log files
  since it is usually more correct.  The binary stream still sends
  the real WX200 time so client programs can notice if it is wrong.

* wind directions are now rounded to the closest 10 degrees in .tab
  files to make them a little smaller.

* new wx200.h and libwx200.a public API for client programs

* wx200 suppresses alarm displays by default, for a smaller display.
  Use -a to get the old behavior.


	NEW for 0.7	Released September 1998
	===========	=======================

* .day summary files contain average/low/high by hour

* .mon summary files contain average/low/high by day

* new wxsum creates the above files from .tab files

* new Makefile.data can be cron'd to auto-update all data files

* new wxplot2html can auto-make monthly and today's web pages

* wxplot can now plot .tab, .day and .mon data files

* many 0.6 bugs fixed; see ChangeLog


	NEW for 0.6	Released February 1998
	===========	======================

* much improved plotting, please read the wxplot(1) man page

	+ better organized
	+ custom units!
	+ any or all variables
	+ any kind of gnuplot output (X, ascii, pbm, etc.), batch mode
	+ WXPLOT env var for your favorite options
	+ multi-day plots work/look better

* -m and -p gone and replaced with smarter host[:port] argument

* wx200 client can now output a specific variable


	NEW for 0.5	Released February 1998
	===========	======================

* man pages!  Yes, the whole thing is properly documented!

* new wxplot for graphing but only if you have perl(1) and gnuplot(1).

* improved wx200d options, check `wx200d -h' or the man page.

* wx200 client can now auto-refresh the display continuously.


	NEW for 0.4	Released January 31, 1998
	===========	=========================

* -z meaning is reversed, use -z to turn off gzip'ing the logs

* data logging is optional, turn off binary logs with -b

* new tab-delimited ASCII logs are also optional, turn them off with -a

* wxz renamed to wxfilter and produces tab-delimited text by default

* new gnuplot.cmd for plotting tab-delimited log files with gnuplot
