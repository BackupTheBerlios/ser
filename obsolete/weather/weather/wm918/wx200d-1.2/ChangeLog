	Postgres was getting tried sometimes when it wasn't completely
	available.  I think I have this fixed now.  Replaced wx200.html with
	an wxindex script which autogenerates the HTML index page thanks to an
	idea by Goran.Sandin@abc.se.

2002-03-30  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* README, wmr918util.c, wx200d.8.in, wx200d.c:

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, README, wx200.html, wxrrdgraph.in, wxrrdupdate.in:
	Graphs now have names so clicking one to switch var/time keeps the
	same graph on screen.  Updated documentation.

	* AUTHORS, wx200.1, wx200.c, wxaprs:
	Added APRS support contributed by Steve Fraser
	<sfraser@sierra.apana.org.au>.

	* Makefile.data.in, wxrrdgraph.in, wxrrdupdate.in:
	wxrrdupdate now fills in the gaps when just one variable changed to
	eliminate the false unknowns.  wxrrdgraph improvements include
	configurable local pressure offset, better wind direction labeling and
	freeze line on temperature graphs.

2001-08-29  Timothy D. Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* config.h.in, configure, Makefile.in, wxrrdgraph.in:

2001-06-24  Timothy D. Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, README, TODO, wx200d.c, wx200d.lsm, wxsum.in:
	Fixed wxsum bug that max temperature and wind chill in .day and .mon
	summaries were recorded as zero when they were really negative.

2001-06-17  Timothy D. Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* config.h.in, configure, Makefile.in, README, TODO, wunderground.in, wx200d.lsm:

	Added #include <getopt.h> to fix bug #213561.

	* ChangeLog, config.h.in, configure, configure.in, Makefile.in:
	Tossed --with-device from configure because it goes against the GNU
	standards.

	wxplot now auto-looks in the data directory for the given files.

	* format.c, NEWS, parse.c, README, wx200.1, wx200.c, wx200d.c, wx200.h, wx200.html, wxread.c:
	Added a lot of options to the wx200 client based on input from "rofo".

	* acconfig.h, aclocal.m4, AUTHORS, config.h, config.h.in, configure, configure.in, COPYING, fixtime, fixtime.in, gstripchart.conf, install-sh, Makefile.am, Makefile.data.in, Makefile.in, missing, mkinstalldirs, NEWS, pg_api.c, pg_api.h, README, serial.c, TODO, wx200.c, wx200d.5, wx200d.5.in, wx200d.8, wx200d.8.in, wx200d.c, wxplot, wxplot2html, wxplot2html.in, wxplot.in, wxsum, wxsum.in:
	Used automake to switch to a standard GNU-style make process.

2001-06-02  Timothy D. Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* ChangeLog, config.h, configure, configure.in, Makefile.in, pg_api.c, pg_api.h, wx200d.8, wx200d.c:

	* Makefile.in, serial.c:
	Switched from termio to POSIX termios based on code subbmitted by Pat
	Jensen <patj@futureunix.net>.  This should support more OSs, e.g. BSD.

2000-07-12  Timothy D. Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* client.c, wxplot.1, wxplot, wxplot2html:
	Added --combine to wxplot to combine indoor and outdoor temps on one
	plot.  Enhanced wxplot2thml to make this a configuration option.
	Thanks to Darren Enns for the ideas.

2000-02-12  Timothy D. Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* ChangeLog, wx200d.lsm, TODO:
	Updated for 1.0.

	* configure: New file.

2000-02-10  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* README, wxstdout.1, wxdebug.1, wxfilter.1, wx200.1, wxplot.1, wx200d.5, wx200d.8:
	Updated for 1.0.

	* Makefile.data.in, Makefile.in:
	Switched to Makefile.in for configure script.

	* configure.in: New file.

	* wxstdout.c, wxread.c, wxfilter.c, unit.c:

	* wxplot2html: Added rain total, removed indoor numbers.

	* buffer.c, serial.c: Tweaked to work with new wx200.h.

	* client.c:
	Save connection error string in wx200error instead of sending to
	stderr.  Let the caller decide what to do.

	* wx200.txt: Fixed email address.

2000-02-08  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wxplot, wxsum, tab.c:
	Added total rain column to the tab-delimited data.

2000-02-07  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* parse.c, wx200d.c, wx200.h:
	If wx200ignoreclock is non-zero, the computer's clock now overrides
	that of the weather station's clock.  This only affects the parsed
	data; the binary data remains unchanged.  This is so better times can
	be logged while clients can still get the real time from the station.

	* serial.h: New file.

2000-01-24  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* format.c:
	Moved the global unit vars into a WX_FORMAT structure called wxformat.

	* wx200.c, wxdebug.c, parse.c:
	Moved the global section vars into a WX structure called wx.

	* wx200.h:
	Began cleaning up the namespace to make a nicer library possible.
	Collected the global variables into structures and added WX_ prefixes
	to the typedefs.

2000-01-01  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wx200.c:
	Removed alarms for more compact display.  Use -a to see them.

	* Makefile.data:
	Eliminated failure to build .mon files on the first run.

	* wxdebug.c: Added timestamps to unknowns.

	* parse.c, wx200.txt: Added Indoor Dewpoint O.R. indicator.

	* wx200.c:
	Swapped indoor and outdoor data columns to put more important outdoor
	first and next to the labels.

	* wxplot: Slight tweak to ytics for compatibility with gnuplot 3.7.
	If this breaks with older gnuplots, just remove `autofreq'.

1998-09-16  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wx200d.c:
	D Fannin <dfannin@yahoo.com> reports <time.h> should be <sys/time.h>
	to work on RedHat.  Either way works for me (on Slackware) so ok.

Tue Sep  8 01:06:41 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* ChangeLog, wx200d.lsm, TODO, README, Makefile: For 0.7.

	* Makefile.data:
	Added > /dev/null to the cron job comments to reduce mail.

	* wx200.1: Documented the single variable output options.

	* wx200.html: Added sample header with links to wxplot2html output.

	* wxplot.1: Added .day, .mon and --[no]errorbars documentation.

	* wx200d.5:
	Documented new .day and .mon files.  Added variable range and
	resolution details.

	* wx200.txt: Tweaked 2 insignificant comments.

Mon Sep  7 22:59:25 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wx200d.c:
	Use syslog(3) for error messages when a daemon.  I arbitrarily chose
	local4 as the facility; anyone have a problem with that?

Sun Sep  6 04:15:50 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wx200d.c:
	Use utime to make sure .tab is as new as .bin for new Makefile.data.

	* wxplot:
	Added the ability to plot new .day and .mon average/low/high summary
	files with or without errorbars.

	* fixtime, Makefile.data, wxplot2html, wxsum: Initial revision

	* wxdebug.c: Fixed missing 0 in the usage message.

	* parse.c: Added Rain O.R., fixed bugs in the wind speed O.R. bits.

	* wx200.c:
	Changed the individual variable output option names and added the
	missing ones to be consistent with the rest of the system.  Changed
	strsep to strtok to be more portable.  Added version to the header.

Sat Sep  5 03:42:39 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wx200.txt:
	Synched up with Glynne's 7/3/98 which adds Rain Rate O.R. bit.

Fri Sep  4 18:14:21 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wx200d.c:
	Close .bin file before .tab file so that a make of the data directory
	could do the Right Thing (TM), that is, re-create .tabs iff necessary.

Mon May  4 00:24:49 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wxplot.1:
	Added --cache, removed month/year boundary limitation of --one.

Sun May  3 06:28:27 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wxplot: Added --cache.

	* wxdebug.c: Added CF.14 to unknowns.

	* wx200.h, parse.c:
	Unknowns bytes now contain only the unknown bits, the known bits are
	set to zero.  Fixed the wind alarm which was in the wrong units.

	* wx200.txt:
	Tweaked format of nibble column so that an ASCII sort results in all
	bits being in order from top to bottom.  Merged Glynne's latest
	including fixing wrong units bug on wind alarm.

Sat Apr 25 18:34:18 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wxplot:
	--one now works across month or year boundaries by converting to
	absolute number of seconds since the epoch.  This is probably even
	slower, but I want to be able to plot things like last 3 days.

Sun Apr 19 05:29:55 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@quiknet.com>

	* wx200.c:
	Fixed bug: NULL pointer problem when no host[:port] specified.

Sat Apr  4 19:04:51 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* client.c, wx200.c, wx200.html:
	Fixed bug: the CGI form didn't work since -m and -p went away.

Thu Apr  2 07:26:05 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wx200.txt: Added Wind Speed out of range indicators in byte CF.25.

Wed Apr  1 06:09:10 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wxplot:
	Fixed bug: when using --one, lines containing negatives were removed.
	Thanks to greg <glarson@dacmail.net> for reporting this bug.

	* wxplot, wxplot.1, wxdebug.1, wx200d.5, wx200.h, wx200.c, wx200.1, unit.c, format.c:
	Corrected spelling of farenheit to Fahrenheit.  Thanks to greg
	<glarson@dacmail.net> for pointing out this bug.  (Duh!)  Also fixed
	capitalization of Celsius in text areas.  The capitalization of both
	words is still wrong in the command-line options because lowercase is
	easier to type and more "typical" there, and in variables in the code.

Sun Feb 22 07:34:52 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* README: Fixed the NEW section (oops).

	* wxplot: Fixed bug: y axis label was wrong for --in.

Sun Feb 22 05:43:43 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* ChangeLog, wx200d.lsm, TODO, Makefile: For 0.6.

	* wxplot.1: Documented all the new options.  I think.

	* wx200.c:
	Merged "Tim Smith" <trs@AZStarNet.com>'s changes which can output just
	one formatted value.  I'll document it later...

	* wx200.c, buffer.c, wx200.h:
	Tweaks in preparation for virtual memories.

	* wx200d.c:
	Backed out .mem file; this virtual memory stuff is going to have to
	wait until my hardware is back from the shop. :(

	* format.c: Fixed capitalization typo.

	* wxplot: Ignore bogus files and lines.

	* wxplot: Added --[no]grid and --[no]timestamp to do obvious things.

	* wxplot:
	Added --[no] sea, local, wind, gust, average to add or remove things.

Sat Feb 21 20:05:09 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wxplot: Added WXPLOT environment variable of preferred options.

	* wxplot:
	Way better plotting capabilities.  --all is now the default if no
	options.  New --[no]indoor and --[no]outdoor options for doing only in
	or out plots respectively.  all in or out temps now plotted on the
	same chart instead of mixing in/out.  New --[no]temps to turn all
	temperature vars on/off.  --one now puts a tic only at day boundaries.

	* wxplot:
	Added --batch which skips the interactive pause between plots.  Added
	--terminal and --output which are passed to gnuplot(1) for arbitrary
	types of output to arbitrary files or pipes.

	* wxplot:
	Fixed bug: multiple files weren't being processed unless --one.

	* wxplot:
	Added custom unit conversion options, thanks to code example from
	"Chance C. Geurin" <cgeurin@divide.net>

Fri Feb 13 04:56:15 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wx200.c:
	Changed wx200bufread read test to be EOF instead of negative since -2
	is a valid return when nothing changed.

	* wx200d.c:
	Background the nightly gzip command so we don't block the server.  If
	-DMINDEBUG, create a file every minute for faster testing of things.
	Added .mem file though it doesn't contain anything yet.

Tue Feb 10 06:34:04 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wxstdout.1, wx200.1, wxstdout.c, wx200.c:
	Tossed -m and -p in favor of new host[:port] parameter.

	* wx200.h, client.c:
	Changed wx200open to take a string of the form host[:port] or NULL.
	If host or port is missing, we look for it in a WX200D env variable.
	Finally, we fall back on built-in defaults from config.h.  We set new
	global vars wx200host and wx200port to the values finally used.

Sat Feb  7 18:18:16 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* ChangeLog, wx200d.lsm, TODO, README: For 0.5.

	* wxdebug.1, wxfilter.1, wxstdout.1, wxplot.1, wx200.1, wx200d.5, wx200d.8:
	Initial revision

	* wx200.h: Added args to all function prototypes.

	* wx200.txt:
	Fixed bug that said O.R.'s return EE.  They don't.  EE is errors.

	* wx200.c: Added last group read indicator to the top-left corner.

	* wxstdout.c, wxfilter.c, wxdebug.c, wx200d.c:
	Fixed bug: getopt case '?' wasn't handled, causing bogus options to
	let the program continue anyway!

	* wxread.c: Takes first arg of serial device (optional).

	* serial.c: Added ability to pass serial device to init_serial.

	* wx200d.c: Added -s and -w.

	* wxdebug.c: Fixed bug in usage (0 and 1 were backwards).

Wed Feb  4 04:47:52 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wx200.html, wx200.c:
	Added -r and --refresh which cause it to continuously refresh the
	display of data.

Mon Feb  2 06:32:45 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wxplot:
	Set the wind direction range to 0 to 360 instead of autoscaled.

Sun Feb  1 06:04:24 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wxplot: Added --one which is slow and won't work across month or year
	boundaries.  Added tic for each hour instead of every 3.

	* wx200.c:
	Fixed usage to be type text/plain instead of text/html for CGI.

	* wx200.c:
	Added host and port to title and header.  Added version to footer.
	Fixed bugs: Display had skipped Baro, making it one-off.  CGI arg
	parsing may have overflowed if given too many args.

	* wxplot: Initial revision

Sat Jan 31 22:32:27 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* ChangeLog, TODO, wx200d.lsm, README, Makefile: For 0.4.

	* gnuplot.cmd: Initial revision

	* config.h: Turned CONNECTIONS down to a more sane limit (256 -> 128).

	* wx200.c: Added gen indicators (display screen, power, low batt).

	* wx200.html: Initial revision

	* wx200.c:
	Now runs as a WWW CGI program if $QUERY_STRING is set (method GET).

	* wx200.c:
	Switched to getopt_long and implemented unit and display format
	options that override the WX200 settings.  See -h or --help.

	* wx200.c: Added alarm values and on/off status.

	* wx200.h, format.c:
	Added format_val which can format and label arbitrary values.

	* unit.c:
	Added ability to convert temperature difference (dew point alarm).

	* parse.c: Fixed a couple bugs in alarms.

	* wx200d.c:
	Since we close all unused fd's (including 0) when we become a daemon,
	the active fd test must be more specific than just a check for
	non-zero since fd 0 may get reused.  Changed it to (fd > -1).

	* wx200.h, tab.c, buffer.c, wx200d.c:
	Tab and binary files were not in synch for the first few samples.
	Corrected this by adding a re-set of the buffer and tab routines
	between new files.  This causes them to start over and say they've
	found something new when they really haven't.

Wed Jan 28 05:51:19 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wx200d.c:
	Toggled meaning of -z so that running with no args does the smartest
	thing (compresses).  Added tab-delimited ASCII log files.  New -a
	option turns off ASCII logs while -b turns off binary logs.

	* wxfilter.c:
	Renamed from wxz.c to be an extendible binary data filter.  Now
	produces tab-delimited ASCII by default.  Use -z to abbreviate data.

	* tab.c: Initial revision

	* wx200.c:
	Use new F_TEMP1 for dew point and wind chill.  Trimmed width.

	* format.c:
	Enhanced unit_format to drop precision if necessary to fit a number in
	width.  E.g. when rain goes from 99.99in to 100.0in.  Added F_TEMP1
	which formats temperatures with no decimals (for dew point and wind
	chill).

Sat Jan 24 16:24:06 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* format.c: Changed descriptions to match those on page 59.

Thu Jan 22 06:56:47 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wx200.c, wx200.h, format.c:

	Now displays same units as on wx200 display, thanks to new unit.c.

	* wx200.h, parse.c:
	Added n, nlo, nhi floats which are recorded in a known base unit to
	simplify unit conversion.  E.g. all temperatures are in celsius.

	* wx200d.c:
	Fixed bug: running without -d didn't work since it closed the serial
	device and socket (oops!).

	* wx200d.c:
	Tossed the alarm in favor of a select test before socket or serial
	read.  Added a sleep between reading to be even nicer to the system.

	* wx200d.c:
	Changed to blocking I/O on the device to simplify continuous reading.
	Now remembers the sections and records/sends only sections that have
	changed.  New `FF' group is a timestamp only (an 8F that hasn't
	otherwise changed).

Thu Jan  8 06:00:18 1998  Tim Witham  <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com>

	* wxread.c: Simplified for new serial.c.

	* serial.c:
