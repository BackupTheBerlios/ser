These are the tables which contain code not autogenerated. Be careful to
back them up before you re-generate their implementation:
applTable
	-> code is slightly different from the rest of the tables, since it's
	in charge of assigning applIndex. In addition it doesn't support
	register_row or register_table
sipCommonCfgTable
	-> additional function to add a row to the table
	-> handlers (mostly example) for columns in this table
sipCommonCfgBase
	-> all of the sipCommonCfgTable functions have been deleted from
	here
sipCommonStatusCode
	-> has a table with traps which makes the generation script crash
	in the middle of the process. So you need to generate each table
	separately (here they're in one file. If you split them up, add
	appropiate #include's to snmp_mod.h and split the 
	init_branch(sipCommonStatusCode)
	call in agent.c accordingly)
