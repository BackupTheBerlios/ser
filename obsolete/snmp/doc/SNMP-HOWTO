Quick instructions to install net-snmp and configure it so you can
play with ser's snmp module:

- You need net-snmp >= 5.0.0 (don't use 5.0.3, it has a bug traversing
tables). The latest the better. You can get it from http://www.net-snmp.org
We don't need any special compilation flags.

Most basic configuration, uses SNMPv1 (for v3 some instructions are below
but you should definitely read the instructions that come with the
net-snmp distribution, at time of writing they're in README.snmpv3). 
You may or may not run a snmp agent on the system (like the snmpd daemon 
that comes from net-snmp).
Steps:
1. Create a $prefix/share/snmp/snmpd.conf with the following:
rwcommunity ser	127.0.0.0/8
master agentx

This allows rw access only to localhost. Change ser for your preferred
community name.

2. If you don't want to run ser as root, create a $prefix/share/snmp/snmp.conf
file with:
defaultPort 9999

[change 9999 with your preferred port number]. However, note that this is
only when you run our agent as a standalone agent. If you want to have
it as a subagent, running ser as non-root becomes more complicated. 
Since these are simple instructions, then you'll need to see
below for details of what needs to be done [TODO]

3. Copy all the .my files from ser's distribution under modules/snmp/doc
to $prefix/share/snmp/mibs.
You can also copy them to ~/.snmp/mibs. However, in this case, you need
to copy it for: 
	-> the user that runs ser
	-> the user that will query the agent (run snmpget/walk/set/etc)

In addition, you need to do for the user which runs ser:
export MIBS=ALL or
setenv MIBS ALL
This tells the snmp library that it should look at all the MIB files
it can find (not only the ones it has for default) when trying to
resolve SNMP's objects names. This is necessary because to make
everybody's life easier we use object names instead of explicit
OIDs.
If ser fails complaining that it couldn't register SNMP objects, this
environment variable is the most probable cause.
