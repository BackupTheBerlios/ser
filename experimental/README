The Experimental Directory
=========================

The experimental directory contains three types of modules:
1. Simple modules that can be dropped into main code tree
2. Modules or code patches that modify the core to accomplish new functionality
3. Backported modules that exist in the HEAD, but can be found in experimental for 
   the currently maintained released branch

Please use:
