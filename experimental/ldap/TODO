TO DO LIST:
-----------

* DATE:        2005-11-10
  FUNCTION:    ldap_is_user_in()
  PROPOSITION: Correct group handling. Store group members' DNs inside 'groupOfNames'
               or 'groupOfUniqueNames' objects.
  CURRENTLY:   Group membership is stored in multivalued, object-specific
               attribute, containing group name that object is a member of.
  NOTES:       1. According to Greger V.Teigre there is an issue with
               groupOfNames. Some LDAP servers do not have built-in functions
               for efficiently checking group membership (i.e. OpenLDAP). We will
               have to make sure that the future implementation of group check
               algorithm will work across LDAP servers.
               2. We could experience schema violations when using
               empty 'groupOfNames' (without any 'member' attribute value, which
               may happen if group has no members). This attribute is
               mandatory according to schemas. However it is perfectly possible
               to enter empty value inside 'member' attribute'.

* DATE:        2005-11-10
  FUNCTION:    ldap_proxy_authorize(), ldap_www_authorize()
  PROPOSITION: Support for hashed LDAP passwords. MD5 should be supported in first place.
  CURRENTLY:   Only plain text passwords stored in LDAP are supported.


* DATE:        2005-11-17
  FUNCTION:    all functions
  PROPOSITION: Test possibility of using SER native memory allocation routines (i.e. pkg_malloc())
  CURRENTLY:   Standard calloc() is used in some functions.


* DATE:        2005-11-19
  FUNCTION:    all functions
  PROPOSITION: Decide whether 'ldap' module should be splitted into
               'auth_ldap'and 'group_ldap'
  CURRENTLY:   Both authorization and group membership functions are in one
               module.
