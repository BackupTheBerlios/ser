TODO LIST:
---------

- Multiple elements in a Path header (the current implementation is too
  one-element-oriented)
- No user token removing (the current implementation removes the token from
  SIP URI in the Path header)
- Put the Route header derived from the path vector route just after Via
  (the current implementation put the Route header the last one in the
  message)
- Use P-Asserted-Identity to perform binding (instead of To/From, as the
  current implementation does)
- Using To/From headers like:

  To: "UE" <ue@domain1.com>

  produce parsing errors in store_path() function. The quoted prefix hurts.
  Fixit.
