* Support for authentication
* Support for SSL

* Implement support for other than str parameters
* Escape values of parameters injected into the search filter
* Proper handling of NULL values
* use the asynchronous functions of the api instead of synchronous
* Support for multi-value attributes (they should be broken up into rows)
