# This is a configuration file for the LDAP module in SER. The configuration
# file maps database table names used in SER to LDAP directory sub-trees to
# be searched. In addition to that the configuration file also allows to
# configure the LDAP search filter and maps database field names to
# LDAP attribute names and vice versa.
#
# Supported Attribute Type Names:
#  * GeneralizedTime
#  * Integer
#  * BitString
#  * Boolean
#  * String
#  * Binary
#  * Float
