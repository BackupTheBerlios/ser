RFC2307: An Approach for Using LDAP as a Network Information Service

RFC2256: A summary of the X.500(96) user Schema for use with LDAPv3

         such as objectClass or cn are defined here.

RFC2587: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure LDAPv2 Schema

RFC2798: Definition of the inetOrgPerson LDAP Object Class

RFC4515: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation
         of Search Filters

RFC4530: LDAP entryUUID Operational Attribute
        This RFC defines the entryUUID operational attribute which can be
        used by the server to assign unique identifiers to objects in the
        directory. Such identifiers can be used to identify the object even
		when the dn of the object changes. Unfortunately the entryUUID attribute
		cannot by modified by the user and thus it is not directly usable for us.
