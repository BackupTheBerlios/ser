	* corrected BUGs - mostly used dstr_get_str instead of dstr_get_data
	because there were some cases when was allocated memory buffers of zero
	length (this consumes memory using shm_malloc), but this memory was NOT
	freed then

2006-02-16
	* removed parts of code prepared for doing "remote" subscriptions - all is
	solved using internal (QSA) subscriptions now (to PA or PRESENCE_B2B or
	RLS itself)
	* UID used instead of username when mode=simple (i.e. "simple" list URIs
	have to be in the form sip:<uid>-list@domain.com)
	* reduced trace messages

2006-02-14
	* separated B2B UA for presence into standalone module presence_b2b
