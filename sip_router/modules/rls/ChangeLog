2006-03-22
	* corrected memory leak
	* reduced sent NOTIFY request count

2006-03-21
	* accepts subscription status through QSA

2006-03-20
	* multiple message queues (one for each virtual subscription) replaced by
	only one message queue for QSA notifications shared by all virtual
	subscriptions
	* xcap_root for resource list subscription stored into database (needed
	for subscription recreation)
	* notification is not propagated if document and content type didn't
	change (non-internal subscriptions only) -> reduced count of NOTIFY
	messages to the subscriber

2006-03-17
	* changed parameters of XCAP queries

2006-03-16
	* internal RLS subscriptions rewritten (i.e. nested lists handling)
	* added xcap_root and xcap_params into rl_subscription structure (needed
	for requeries, future XCAP notifications, ...)

2006-03-15
	* removed parameter "mode" (now is query done before handle_subscription
	function and nested subscriptions can not be handled as "simple"
	subscriptions
	* added functions query_rls_services, query_resource_list, have_flat_list

2006-03-07
	* corrected BUG - improper adding virtual subscriptions into list

2006-02-28
	* corrected BUG - one shot timer used for DB initialization was not in
	shared memory

2006-02-27
	* corrected BUGs - mostly used dstr_get_str instead of dstr_get_data
	because there were some cases when was allocated memory buffers of zero
	length (this consumes memory using shm_malloc), but this memory was NOT
	freed then

2006-02-16
	* removed parts of code prepared for doing "remote" subscriptions - all is
	solved using internal (QSA) subscriptions now (to PA or PRESENCE_B2B or
	RLS itself)
	* UID used instead of username when mode=simple (i.e. "simple" list URIs
	have to be in the form sip:<uid>-list@domain.com)
	* reduced trace messages

2006-02-14
	* separated B2B UA for presence into standalone module presence_b2b
