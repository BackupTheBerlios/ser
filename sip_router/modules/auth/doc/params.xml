    <section id="auth.auth_extra_checks">
	<title><varname>auth_extra_checks</varname> (flags)</title>
	<para>
	    If set to a non-zero value, extra authentication checks will be
	    enabled. The default value is 0 (old behaviour, no extra checks).
	</para>
	<para>
		Without the extra checks the nonce will protect only against expired
		values. Some reply attacks are still possible in the expire "window".
		A possible workarround is to always force qop 
		 authentification and always check the uri from the authorization
		 header, but this would not work if an upstream proxy rewrites the uri
		 and it will also not work with a lot of UA implementations.
	</para>
	<para>
		In this case the nonce value will be used only to hold
		the expire time (see <varname>nonce_expire</varname>) and an MD5
		over it and some secret (the MD5 is used to make sure that nobody
		tampers with the nonce expire time).
	</para>
	<para>
		When the extra checks are enabled, the nonce will include and extra
		MD5 over the selected part/parts of the message (see below) and some 
		other secret. This will be used to check if the selected part of 
		the message is the same when an UA tries to reuse the nonce, thus 
		protecting or severely limiting reply attacks.
	</para>
	<para>
		The possible flag values for <varname>auth_extra_checks</varname>
		are: 1 for checking if the message uri changed (uses the whole
		 uri), 2 for checking the callid, 4 for the from tag and 8 for the
		 source ip (see nonce.h). For example setting 
		 <varname>auth_extra_checks</varname> to 6 would check if the callid
		 or the from tag changed from the message for which the original nonce
		 was generated (this would allow nonce reuse only within the same 
		 dialog and for the expire time).
		Note that enabling the extra checks will limit nonce caching by UAs, 
		requiring extra challenges and roundtrips, but will provide much better
		protection.
	</para>
	<para>
		When the <varname>secret</varname> parameter is set and the extra
		checks are enabled, the first half of the <varname>secret</varname> 
		will be used for the expire time MD5 and the other half for the extra
		checks MD5, so make sure you have a long secret (32 chars or longer are
		recommended).

    <section id="nonce_expire">
	<title><varname>nonce_expire</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    Nonces have limited lifetime. After a given period of time nonces
	    will be considered invalid. This is to protect replay
	    attacks. Credentials containing a stale nonce will be not
	    authorized, but the user agent will be challenged again. This time
	    the challenge will contain <varname>stale</varname> parameter which
	    will indicate to the client that it doesn't have to disturb user by
	    asking for username and password, it can recalculate credentials
	    using existing username and password.
	</para>
	<para>
	    The value is in seconds and default value is 300 seconds.
	</para>
