	* call to timer_presentity in handle_subscription replaced by call to
	send_notify and remove_watcher_if_expired (i.e. sending notification to
	all watchers immediately -> sending notification to new/updated watcher)

2006-02-27
	* corrected BUGs - mostly used dstr_get_str instead of dstr_get_data
	because there were some cases when was allocated memory buffers of zero
	length (this consumes memory using shm_malloc), but this memory was NOT
	freed then

2006-02-15
	* RPC function pa.publish uses UID instead of uri!
	* XCAP uris for authorization documents contain UID instead of username!
	* added configurable max_subscription_expiration (undocumented)

2006-02-14
	* added parameter for disabling processing internal subscriptions

2006-02-02
	* added handling of <person> element from RPID (whole <person> elements
	are stored and put into NOTIFY messages; they are not processed in any
	way due to its complexity - see the rpid draft) => this will be changed 
	to process ALL unknown elements from PIDF documents
	* improved documentation (offline winfo, parameters, ...)

2006-02-01
	* added functions for storing offline auth. info (store_winfo and
	dump_stored_winfo) into database [they don't work in memory],
	documentation will be added soon

2006-01-30
	* added function target_online
	* added parameter use_callbacks (int) - [if set to 0, no callback are
	used]
	* corrected handle_publish - returns 4xx for unsupported events instead of
	OK
