	* added handling of <person> element from RPID (whole <person> elements
	are stored and put into NOTIFY messages; they are not processed in any
	way due to its complexity - see the rpid draft) => this will be changed 
	to process ALL unknown elements from PIDF documents
	* improved documentation (offline winfo, parameters, ...)

2006-02-01
	* added functions for storing offline auth. info (store_winfo and
	dump_stored_winfo) into database [they don't work in memory],
	documentation will be added soon

2006-01-30
	* added function target_online
	* added parameter use_callbacks (int) - [if set to 0, no callback are
	used]
	* corrected handle_publish - returns 4xx for unsupported events instead of
	OK
