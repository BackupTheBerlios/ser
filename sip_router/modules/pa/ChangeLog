2006-04-11
	* changed QSA (reduced memory allocations)

2006-04-10
	* changed QSA - corrected content-type propagation

2006-04-07
	* added function check_subscription_status and removed AVP operations due
	to problems with them (after sending NOTIFY in handle_subscription are
	AVPs lost!)
	* store_offline_winfo and check_subscription_status uses global variable
	with last subscription status instead of AVP (see above)
	* added parameter pres_rules_file which specifies filename used in XCAP
	queries instead of default presence-rules.xml

2006-04-06
	* xcap queries moved into xcap module

2006-04-04
	* sending empty string in NOTIFY bodies - TCP requires content-length and
	if sending message with NULL body, it is not set
	* handle_subscription sets AVP subscription_status (pending, terminated,
	error)
	* store_offline_winfo stores status from AVP subscription_status

2006-04-03
	* function for server contact extraction was moved into common libraries
	(it is used by RLS too)

2006-03-29
	* added function for MESSAGE authorization

2006-03-28
	* added parameter max_publish_expiration (max time for expiration of
	information published via PUBLISH request)

2006-03-27
	* added (empty) function for message authorization
	* corrected bug in offline watcherinfo dumping (removed were messages with
	id less or equal than requested instead of equal only)

2006-03-23
	* added debugging messages into send_winfo_notify due to problems with
	messages (Long UDP messages are sometimes ignored by clients; sometimes
	are too big to be sent. But there are problems with TCP too!)

2006-03-22
	* using get_content_length instead of strlen(body)

2006-03-21
	* flag (PFLAG_WATCHERINFO_CHANGED, WFLAG_SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGED) settings in
	internals, not in handle_subscription
	* sets subscription status for internal subscriptions (QSA)

2006-03-20
	* setting flag PFLAG_WATCHERINFO_CHANGED only for new subscriptions
	because we don't send expiration in watcherinfo documents and thus it is
	only "spamming" if we send watcherinfo for resubscriptions too

2006-03-17
	* changed XCAP query parameters

2006-03-02
	* improved robustness of libs (CDS, presence) and PA
	* cosmetical changes

2006-03-01
	* corrected BUG - Contact was sent in 200 response, now in all 2xx
	responses
	* cleaning WFLAG_SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGED after notification sent (in
	handle_subscription)
	* small cosmetical and robustness improving changes

2006-02-28
	* call to timer_presentity in handle_subscription replaced by call to
	send_notify and remove_watcher_if_expired (i.e. sending notification to
	all watchers immediately -> sending notification to new/updated watcher)

2006-02-27
	* corrected BUGs - mostly used dstr_get_str instead of dstr_get_data
	because there were some cases when was allocated memory buffers of zero
	length (this consumes memory using shm_malloc), but this memory was NOT
	freed then

2006-02-15
	* RPC function pa.publish uses UID instead of uri!
	* XCAP uris for authorization documents contain UID instead of username!
	* added configurable max_subscription_expiration (undocumented)

2006-02-14
	* added parameter for disabling processing internal subscriptions

2006-02-02
	* added handling of <person> element from RPID (whole <person> elements
	are stored and put into NOTIFY messages; they are not processed in any
	way due to its complexity - see the rpid draft) => this will be changed 
	to process ALL unknown elements from PIDF documents
	* improved documentation (offline winfo, parameters, ...)

2006-02-01
	* added functions for storing offline auth. info (store_winfo and
	dump_stored_winfo) into database [they don't work in memory],
	documentation will be added soon

2006-01-30
	* added function target_online
	* added parameter use_callbacks (int) - [if set to 0, no callback are
	used]
	* corrected handle_publish - returns 4xx for unsupported events instead of
	OK
