    <section id="fr_timer">
	<title><varname>fr_timer</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    Timer which hits if no final reply for a request or ACK for a
	    negative INVITE reply arrives (in milliseconds).
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 30 seconds.

	<para>
	    Timer which hits if no final reply for an INVITE arrives after a
	    provisional message was received (in milliseconds).
	</para>

    <section id="wt_timer">
	<title><varname>wt_timer</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    Time for which a transaction stays in memory to absorb delayed
	    messages after it completed; also, when this timer hits,
	    retransmission of local cancels is stopped (a puristic but complex
	    behavior would be not to enter wait state until local branches are
	    finished by a final reply or FR timer--we simplified).
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 5 seconds.
	</para>

	<para>
	    Maximum retransmission period (in milliseconds). The retransmission

    <section id="noisy_ctimer">
	<title><varname>noisy_ctimer</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    If set, INVITE transactions that time-out (FR INV timer) will be 
		always replied. If it's not set, the transaction has only one
		branch and no response was ever received on this branch, it 
		will be silently dropped (no 408 reply will be generated)
		This behavior is overridden if a request is forked, the transaction
		 has a failure route or callback, or some functionality explicitly 
		 turned it on  for a transaction (like acc does to avoid unaccounted
		 transactions due to expired timer).
		Turn this off only if you know the client UACs will timeout and their
		timeout interval fro INVITEs is lower or equal than tm's
		<varname>fr_inv_timer</varname>.
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 1 (on).

	<section id="unix_tx_timeout">
	<title><varname>unix_tx_timeout</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
		Unix socket transmission timeout, in milliseconds.
	</para>
	<para>
		If unix sockets are used (e.g.: to communicate with sems) and sending
		a message on a unix socket takes longer then 
		<varname>unix_tx_timeout</varname>, the send will fail.
	</para>
	<para>
	    The default value is 500 milliseconds.
	</para>

    <section id="aggregate_challenges">
	<title><varname>aggregate_challenges</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
		If set (default), the final reply is a 401 or a 407 and more then
		one branch received a 401 or 407, then all the WWW-Authenticate and 
		Proxy-Authenticate headers from all the 401 and 407 replies will 
		be aggregated in a new final reply. If only one branch received the
		 winning 401 or 407 then this reply will be forwarded (no new one
		 will be built).
		If 0 only the first 401, or if no 401 was received the first 407,  will
		be forwarded (no header aggregation).
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 1 (required by rfc3261).
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>aggregate_challenges</varname> parameter</title>

    <section id="reparse_invite">
	<title><varname>reparse_invite</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
		If set (default), the CANCEL and negative ACK requests are
		constructed from the INVITE message which was sent out instead
		of building them from the received request. The disadvantage is
		that the outgoing INVITE has to be partially re-parsed, the advantage
		is that the CANCEL/ACK is always RFC 3261-compliant, it always
		contains the same route-set as the INVITE message. Do not disable
		the INVITE re-parsing for example in the following cases:
	</para>
	<para>
		- The INVITE contains a preloaded route-set, and SER forwards
		the message to the next hop according to the Route header. The
		Route header is not removed in the CANCEL without
		<varname>reparse_invite</varname>=1.
	</para>
	<para>
		- SER record-routes, thus an in-dialog INVITE contains a Route
		header which is removed during loose routing. If the in-dialog
		INVITE is rejected, the negative ACK still contains the Route
		header without <varname>reparse_invite</varname>=1.
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 1.
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>reparse_invite</varname> parameter</title>
	    <programlisting>
...
modparam("tm", "reparse_invite", 0)

    </section>

    <section id="ac_extra_hdrs">
	<title><varname>ac_extra_hdrs</varname> (string)</title>
	<para>
		Header fields prefixed by this parameter value are included
		in the CANCEL and negative ACK messages if they were present
		in the outgoing INVITE.
	</para>
	<para>
		Note, that the parameter value effects only those headers
		which are not covered by RFC-3261 (which are neither mandatory
		nor prohibited in CANCEL and ACK), and the parameter can be used
		only together with <varname>reparse_invite</varname>=1.
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is "".
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>ac_extra_hdrs</varname> parameter</title>

    <section id="blst_503">
	<title><varname>blst_503</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
		If set and the blacklist support is enabled, every 503 reply source is
		added to the blacklist. The initial blacklist timeout (or ttl) depends
		on the presence of a Retry-After header in the reply and the values of
		the following tm parameters: <varname>blst_503_def_timeout</varname>, 
		<varname>blst_503_min_timeout</varname> and 
		<varname>blst_503_max_timeout</varname>.
	</para>
	<para>
		<emphasis>WARNING:</emphasis>blindly allowing 503 blacklisting could 
		be very easily exploited for DOS attacks in most network setups.
	</para>
	<para>

	</para>
	<para>
		The default value is 0, which means that if no Retry-After header is
		present, the 503 reply source will not be blacklisted (rfc conformant
		 behaviour).

    <section id="blst_methods_add">
	<title><varname>blst_methods_add</varname> (unsigned integer)</title>
	<para>
		Bitmap of method types that trigger blacklisting on
		transaction timeouts. (This setting has no
		effect on blacklisting because of send failures.)
	</para>
	<para>
		The following values are associated to the request methods:
		INVITE=1, CANCEL=2, ACK=4 (not retransmitted, thus, never
		times-out), BYE=8, INFO=16, REGISTER=32, SUBSCRIBE=64,
		NOTIFY=126, OTHER=256 (all the unknown types).
		Check parser/msg_parser.h for farther details.
	</para>
	<para>
		Change the value carefully, because requests not having
		provisional response (everything but INVITE) can easily
		cause the next hop to be inserted into the blacklist
		by mistake. For exmaple the next hop is a proxy, it is alive,
		but waiting for the response of the UAS, and has higher
		fr_timer value.
	</para>
	<para>
		The default value is 1, only INVITEs trigger blacklisting
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>blst_methods_add</varname> parameter</title>

		before statefull forwarding.
		See also <varname>blst_methods_add</varname>

    <section id="cancel_b_method">
	<title><varname>cancel_b_method</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
		Method used when attempting to CANCEL an unreplied transaction branch
		(a branch where no reply greater the 99 was received).
		The possible values are 0, 1, and 2.
	</para>
	<para>
		<emphasis>0</emphasis> will immediately stop the request (INVITE) 
		retrasmission on the branch and it will behave as if the branch was 
		immediately replied with a 487 (a fake internal 487 reply). The 
		advantage is the unreplied branches will be terminated immediately.
		However it introduces a race risk with a possible slightly delayed
		 2xx reply. In this case we could have an UA receiving a 2xx after a
		 487. Moreover this risk is greatly amplified by packet loss
		(e.g. if an 180 is lost the branch will look as unreplied and
		 a CANCEL will silently drop the branch, but a 2xx can still come at
		 a later time).
	</para>
	<para>
		<emphasis>1</emphasis> will keep retransmitting the request on 
		unreplied branches. If a provisional answer is later received a CANCEL
		will be immediately sent back (attempting to quickly trigger a 487). 
		This approach is race free and avoids the 2xx after 487 problem, but
		 it's more resource intensive: faced with a branch towards and UA that
		 doesn't answer, a CANCEL attempt will keep the transaction alive for
		 the whole timeout interval (<varname>fr_timer</varname>).
	</para>
	<para>
		<emphasis>2</emphasis> will send and retransmit CANCEL even on 
		unreplied branches, stopping the request retransmissions. This has the
		same advantages as <emphasis>1</emphasis> and also avoids the extra 
		roundtrip in the case of the provisional reply, but it's not RFC 3261 
		conforming (the RFC allows sending CANCELs only on pending branches).
	</para>
	<para>
		The default value is 0 (the same behaviour as ser versions
		less then 2.1).
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>cancel_b_method</varname> parameter</title>
