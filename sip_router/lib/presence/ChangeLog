	* subscription status propagation through QSA

2006-03-20
	* extra information (record_id, package, ...) in QSA notificaltions
	(client_notify_info_t) replaced by pointer to subscription [may be a bit
	problematic, but much simplier and saving memory for QSA subscriptions
	used in PA, RLS, PRESENCE_B2B]
