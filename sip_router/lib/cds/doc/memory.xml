<title>Memory operations</title>

<partintro>
<para>Memory operations are common for whole CDS library. Because it must work
together with SER's memory management and must work without it too, there are
standalone functions (?macros in the future?) which cover internal
implementation of memory allocation/deallocation functions.
</para>

<para>It is possible to redefine these functions to help with memory debugging
or for monitoring purposes or so.
</para>

<!--
<para>It might be useful some parts of code determined for SER probe out of it,
with a memory debugging tool like valgrind
</para> -->
